This is the implementation of the [pyScope](https://github.com/WWGolay/pyScope) package specific to the [MACRO Consortium](http://macroconsortium.org/) (Macalester-Augustana-Coe Robotic Observatory). pyScope is a pure-Python package for robotic scheduling, operation, and control of small optical telescopes. The MACRO Consortium operates the Robert L. Mutel Telescope (RLMT) located at the [Winer Observatory](https://winer.org/) in Sonoita, Arizona. The RLMT is a Planewave CDK-20, 0.5m f/6.8 Corrected Dall-Kirkham tekescope with an SBIG Alum AC-4040 CMOS camera. With 11 filters and a miniature grating-prism (grism) spectrometer, the RLMT is capable of a wide variety of science.
