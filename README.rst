This is the repository for `pyscope <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
a pure-Python package for robotic scheduling, operation, and control of small
optical telescopes.

`pyscope <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is an
`open-source <LICENSE>`_ project that provides a set of tools to rapidly and easily
control astronomical instrumentation. It is designed to be modular and extensible,
allowing users to easily add support for new devices and observatories.
`pyscope <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is built on top of the
`ASCOM <https://ascom-standards.org/>`_ standard, but also provides support for
non-ASCOM devices. Users may also access their devices through third-party applications
such as `MaxIm DL <https://diffractionlimited.com/product/maxim-dl/>`_.

Observatories who use `pyscope <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ can take
advantage of the `telrun <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyscope.telrun.html>`_
module, which provides a simple interface for fully-robotic observatory control.

`pyscope <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is aiming to become an
`astropy-affiliated package <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/>`_.

Features
--------
* Control observatory hardware with Python

* Support for `ASCOM <https://ascom-standards.org/>`_ and non-ASCOM devices

* `Observatory <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auto_api/pyscope.observatory.Observatory.html>`_
  convenience methods like `run_autofocus <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auto_api/pyscope.observatory.Observatory.html#pyscope.observatory.Observatory.run_autofocus>`_
  and `recenter <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auto_api/pyscope.observatory.Observatory.html#pyscope.observatory.Observatory.recenter>`_

* `telrun <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyscope.telrun.html>`_ module
  for fully-robotic operation of an observatory

* Basic data reduction tools like
  `avg_fits <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auto_api/pyscope.reduction.avg_fits.html>`_
  and `ccd_calib <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auto_api/pyscope.reduction.ccd_calib.html#pyscope.reduction.ccd_calib>`_

* Simple analysis scripts like
  `calc_zmag <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auto_api/pyscope.analysis.calc_zmag.html#pyscope.analysis.calc_zmag>`_

* Powered by `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_,
  `Astropy-affiliated <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/>`_
  packages, and `ASCOM <https://ascom-standards.org/>`_

Installation
------------
pyscope is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyscope

pyscope will be available on conda-forge soon.

Development Installation
========================
|Codespaces|

We recommend using a virtual environment for development. You may create a new
virtual environment with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m venv pyscope-dev
    source pyscope-dev/bin/activate

Or with conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n pyscope-dev python=3.12
    conda activate pyscope-dev

To install pyscope for development, clone the repository and install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/macro-consortium/pyscope
    cd pyscope
    pip install -e ".[dev]"

Usage
-----
TBD

Documentation
-------------
All supporting documentation can be found at `readthedocs <https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Citing
------
If you use this package in your research, please cite it using the following:

History
-------
pyscope is based off of the IOTAlib (Iowa Optical Telescope Automation library) package, drawing on 25+ years of robotic observatory development at the University of Iowa, now with an emphasis on usage by anyone with a computerized telescope and python experience.
