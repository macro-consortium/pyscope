This directory contains sample Python code for communicating with PWI4
via its HTTP API.

The main module is pwi4_client.py, which can be imported from other Python
scripts and serves as a reference implementation for the available commands
and status information offered by the HTTP API. This module can be used
as-is, or it can be adapted to other programming languages as needed.

A few other sample scripts using pwi4_client are also included:

pwi4_build_model.py: Shows how to build a pointing model using available API calls
pwi4_client_demo.py: Provides a basic example of how to control a mount using pwi4_client
pwi4_startup.py: Provides a sample script to help start up a PWI4-controlled telescope

If you have any questions about using this API, please contact PlaneWave Instruments.
