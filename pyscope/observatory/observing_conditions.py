        This class defines the interface for observing conditions, including methods

        update for a given property, and properties for various environmental conditions.
        Subclasses must implement the abstract methods and properties in this class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : `tuple`
            Variable length argument list.
        **kwargs : `dict`

        Even if the driver to the sensor isn't connected, if the sensor itself is implemented, this method must
        return a valid string, for example in case an application wants to determine what sensors are available.

        Parameters
        ----------
        PropertyName : `str`
