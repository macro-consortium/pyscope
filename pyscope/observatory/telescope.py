        See `MoveAxis`'s description for more information. Should return an empty set
        if `MoveAxis` is not supported.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Axis : `enum`
            The axis about which the telescope may be moved. See below for example values:
                * 0 : Primary axis, usually corresponding to Right Ascension or Azimuth.

        Notes

        Rates must be absolute non-negative values only. Determining direction
        of motion should be done by the application by applying the appropriate
        sign to the rate. This is to not have the driver present a duplicate

    @abstractmethod
    def MoveAxis(self, Axis, Rate):
        """
        Move the telescope at the given rate about the specified axis.

        The rate is a value between 0.0 and the maximum value returned by `AxisRates`.
        This movement will continue indefinitely until `MoveAxis` is called again with a rate of 0.0,
        at which point the telescope will restore rate to the one set by `Tracking`. Tracking motion
        is disabled during this movement about axis. The method can be called for each axis independently,
        with each axis moving at its own rate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Axis : `enum`
            The axis about which the telescope may be moved. See below for example values:
                * 0 : Primary axis, usually corresponding to Right Ascension or Azimuth.
                * 1 : Secondary axis, usually corresponding to Declination or Altitude.
                * 2 : Tertiary axis, usually corresponding to imager rotators.
        Rate : `float`
            Rate of motion in degrees per second. Positive values indicate motion in one direction,
            negative values in the opposite direction, and 0.0 stops motion by this method and resumes tracking motion.

        Notes
        -----
        Rate must be within the values returned by `AxisRates`. Note that those values are absolute,
        and the direction of motion is determined by the sign of the rate given here. This sets `Slewing`
        much like `SlewToAltAz` or `SlewToCoordinates` would, and is therefore affected by `AbortSlew`.
        Depending on `Tracking` state, a setting rate of 0.0 will reset the scope to the previous `TrackingRate`,
        or to no movement at all.
