"""
The `observatory` module provides classes and functions for controlling and automating
observatory hardware and operations. This currently includes support only for the
`Robert L. Mutel Telescope` at the University of Iowa, but is designed to be extensible
to all motorized observatory telescopes in the future.
Operations include managing telescopes, cameras, focuser, filter wheels, domes, and other
devices commonly found in an observatory setup.
